<summary>Why do I get `Loading ...` using `JSONSchemaViewer` ?</summary>

Several reasons, most likely :

1. You have an error not related to `docusaurus-json-schema-plugin` in your codebase like [this one](https://github.com/jy95/docusaurus-json-schema-plugin/issues/17) : missing language(s) in prism config / ...
2. You broke the [rules of hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html) or one of your dependancies did
3. You have more than [one copy of React in the same app](https://reactjs.org/warnings/invalid-hook-call-warning.html) or mismatching versions of React and React DOM

If none of these helped you, consider to have a reproducible example before asking help to [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/community/support) / [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13991)

<summary>Which features of JSON Schema are not supported yet ?</summary>

It is explained on the [Roadmap page](next-steps)
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why the minimal JSON Schema version is Draft-07 ?</summary>

Several reasons :
- Many actors (like [ajv](https://ajv.js.org/guide/schema-language.html#draft-07-and-draft-06) ) acknowledge that it is most widely used version of JSON Schema specification
- Many tools don't care anymore for older versions such as Draft-04
- It fits my needs when I designed this project

:::tip

You can migrate schemas from draft-04 to draft-07 using [ajv-cli](https://github.com/ajv-validator/ajv-cli#migrate-schemas)

<summary>How to support specifications that extends the one of JSON Schema (such as OpenAPI, MongoDB, ... )</summary>

That is a good question as many extensions exist in the wild : 
- [OpenAPI](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html) 
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/operator/query/jsonSchema/)
- ...

In the case of OpenAPI, since [OpenAPI 3.1](https://www.openapis.org/blog/2021/02/16/migrating-from-openapi-3-0-to-3-1-0)+ , they are now valid [Draft 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/release-notes.html) JSON Schema so compatible with this lib.  

For the time being, it is low priority as several aspects needs to be considered that might lead to issues , breaking changes, ...
